### <font color="#7359b3">Self Evaluation</font>
***What is the project you have been working on this term?***

- 3D Model of a cat in Blender

***Do you think you successfully did this?***

- Yes

***What parts of your project do you like?***

- I like his little feetsies and the :3 expression I gave him

***What could you improve on, and what part would you do differently next time?***

- I could have done better with remeshing as there ended up being some holes and weird topology until the very end, and if I had the time I might sit down and learn why that happens and how to properly fix or avoid it next time.

***What part of the work did you find the most difficult and why?***

- Working with tiny details like the feet, mouth, and ears was the hardest, because I don't know my way around the brushes well enough to cleanly deform things without messing something else up, and the poly count wasn't high enough to cheese it.

## Main Project

### Blockout
Very basic first shapes
![](scfirstblockout.png)
---
Slightly less basic initial shapes made symmetrical with the Mirror modifier. (also turning on smooth shading)

### Early Sculpting
Joining the blockout shapes (head and body separately) and adjusting the shapes to prepare for remeshing.

Remeshing and making more adjustments with the Crease, Grab and Smooth tools.
