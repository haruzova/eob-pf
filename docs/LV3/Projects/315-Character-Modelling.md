### Self Evaluation
***What is the project you have been working on this term?***

> 3D Model of a cat in Blender

***Do you think you successfully did this?***

> Yes

***What parts of your project do you like?***

> I like his little feetsies and the :3 expression I gave him

***What could you improve on, and what part would you do differently next time?***

> I could have done better with remeshing as there ended up being some holes and weird topology until the very end, and if I had the time I might sit down and learn why that happens and how to properly fix or avoid it next time.

***What part of the work did you find the most difficult and why?***

> Working with tiny details like the feet, mouth, and ears was the hardest, because I don't know my way around the brushes well enough to cleanly deform things without messing something else up, and the poly count wasn't high enough to cheese it.

Slightly less basic initial shapes made symmetrical with the Mirror modifier. (also turning on smooth shading)

### Early Sculpting
Joining the blockout shapes (head and body separately) and adjusting the shapes to prepare for remeshing.
