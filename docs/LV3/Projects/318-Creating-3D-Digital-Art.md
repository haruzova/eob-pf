### Self Evaluation
***What is the project you have been working on this term?***

> 3D Environment in Unreal Engine

***Do you think you successfully did this?***

> Yes

***What parts of your project do you like?***

> I like my little flower patches and the hidden monuments in places. I think it's cute.

***What could you improve on, and what part would you do differently next time?***

> I could have done it a lot faster/more efficiently, and next time I think I would chill out a bit on adding a bunch of tiny details that nobody would ever see.

***What part of the work did you find the most difficult and why?***

> I found it difficult to open Unreal Engine and navigate the scene, partially because of a weird psychological thing, and partially because I'm really not used to the controls and kept getting dizzy while navigating.

Decided I need to annotate the reference like a weirdo so that I know exactly which rock goes where or else I will EXPLODE!!!!!!!

This was so straightforward I genuinely forgot to take progress screenshots, but hey. Cool tower!
### Getting slightly distracted/Background elements

I really wanted to do some background elements so the tower wasn't all lonely and so it matched the concept art better, so I added those. And more.
