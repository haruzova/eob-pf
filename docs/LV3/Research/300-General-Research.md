#### (I) - Choose 2 roles in the game industry. Research and write about what each of these roles do.
This is something I've already researched a bunch, so I'll just plop them here lest I repeat myself.

??? info "3D Character Artists - *(From **[315 - Character Modelling](LV3/Research/315-Character-Modelling.md)**)*"
    3D character artists' primary job is to create the models for all the characters (players, enemies, NPCs) in games, usually based on concept art or previous designs/older models. They work within the specifications of a brief in order to translate it into a functional and game-ready 3D model.

    In order to be a 3D character artist, the most important skills would be proficiency in digital sculpting and modelling, as well as being comfortable with UV mapping and texturing. It's also helpful to have a high level of relevant technical and creative knowledge, such as having a confident understanding of edge loops and mesh topology, as well as general art fundamentals such as anatomy, structure, shapes, and silhouettes.

??? info "Audio Engineer - *(From **[323 - Creating Audio for Digital Media](LV3/Research/323-Creating-Audio-for-Digital-Media.md)**)*"
    Audio engineers (also known as sound engineers or technicians) are tasked with a number of highly technical and creative jobs in audio production; they are considered responsible for jobs such as recording, editing, mixing, refining and mastering audio, along with managing, maintaining and proficiently operating the audio equipment required for those jobs. 

#### (II) - Choose one game studio and research what games they have made. Remember to fill it with screenshots and videos!

### Developer Portfolio Platforms

#### (I) - What is a developer portfolio platform?
A developer portfolio platform is a place to showcase your game dev work to others, such as code samples, project demos, concept work and finished games. This can be useful to show potential employers and collaborators what you've achieved and what you're capable of. 

#### (II) - Name some platforms
