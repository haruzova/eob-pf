### <font color="#7359b3">Self Evaluation</font>
***What is the project you have been working on this term?***

- 2D Platformer Game in Godot

***Do you think you successfully did this?***

- Yes. Mostly.

***What parts of your project do you like?***

- I like the little shrimpy clouds in the background and the player character's idle animation because they're cute and I think I did an okay job with them.

***What could you improve on, and what part would you do differently next time?***

- I could have definitely been a lot more organised in how I actually got everything working, as well as not forgetting to add audio... Next time, the first thing I'd do would be to start off using asset packs in order to get the game figured out, and work out what sprites I want to make afterwards. It slowed things down a lot (and demotivated me because UGHHH tile creation)

***What part of the work did you find the most difficult and why?***

- Making pixel art, tilesets especially, was really hard,because I'm not used to using colour so much, or doing the maths you need to do for tiling assets. Even if it's just basic +, - , x, / stuff... It's hard...

Making a start on the 2D platformer game in Unreal Engine, except I actually did it like last week and it's in Godot instead because I like it more. Sorry
It's using the Sunnyland asset pack here, but i don't like it much and they don't look good with any of my sprite styles so they will be replaced and tossed into the abyss. I foresee absolutlely no undesirable consequences

![20230929-Godot.png](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1U9GvDNQPx-Lc6NAviHkNIHxAa_WZixQb&sz=s4000)

Also godot 4.1 has a bug on Android where it'll throw up these errors every time you save ANYTHING for no reason. She's so crazyyyy Love her !!!

we interrupt this program to bring you: learning about blueprints/visual scripting in Unreal (it is not fun)

![unreal-2.png](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1m_hgXuH27KTY72lvnt_QW8fTrOxH4A3n&sz=s4000)

If these seem hard to read or understand at this scale, then I have successfully taught you what visual scripting is like with a processing disorder (update: they're in better resolution now, but I BET it still looks like nonsense)

In-game view (ft. some glitching tiles and an old second character sprite I tested after making scrimblo but eventually gave up on)

### Adding hazards and platforms

I added a world barrier/kill box so if you fall into the spike pit you **<font color="#ff0000">DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</font>** i lost the picture for th

I did it right this time :) still no health system though. Also that little purple thing is a moving platform but i have NO IDEA when that became a thing
##### ??/??/24
The health bar actually works now. I forgot when this happened. I woke up and it worked. Also, eating the cake now heals 1HP and the orbs deal 1HP damage.

### Level design

Started animating some assets like the orb and cake (they wiggle now), and added a rough layout of the actual demo level

### It's really that shrimple (more sprites and mechanics)

I FINALLY had to figure out what signals do in between these two things and suddenly things started making sense. I gained a brain cell!!!

![pillars.png](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1ef_Tc0VmB_IeOQKaz_l5SvhSLzlDX8sF&sz=s4000)

one of the platform thingies is a tileset and the other is a table/elevator that activates when you grab the cake on it :3
