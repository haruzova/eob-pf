## Self Evaluation
***What is the project you have been working on this term?***
> A 3D scene with animated elements made in Blender.

***Do you think you successfully did this?***
> Hell Yeah Babey

***What parts of your project do you like?***
> I like the ghost and how he wiggly (go white boy go!)

***What could you improve on, and what part would you do differently next time?***
> The lighting isn't that visually interesting and looks flat on some parts, and I would probably work on that first. I might also give the heart a more interesting appearance like how the ghost is a little transparent, either make it look more item-y by using a voxel approach for the model or make it have a gummy kind of texture
> The objects aren't very well organised because I totally forgot to do that, which could be improved.

***What part of the work did you find the most difficult and why?***
> I struggled somewhat with animating since I've never done it before, and I kept making mistakes like moving the keyframes

Turning a round cube into the mushroom's silly little hat by turning on proportional editing and moving the bottom vertex so it "squishes" into the right shape

Adding little spots to the mushroom also using proportional editing, using ++ctrl++ to place them on the base shape + then adjusting them manually so they don't stick out

I also gave it eyes, they're just rounded cuboids not much to see

##### 16/06/25
Creating the ghost's shape by chopping off the bottom half of a rounded cube and extruding downwards, then adding a wavy bottom skirt by moving every other vertex on the bottom loop downwards.

Adding thickness to the ghost by (PLACEHOLDER I FORGOT) then subdividing it and shading smooth. I won't mention it every time but pretty much everything gets subdivided and smooth shading-ed

I copyright infringed on the mushroom and gave his eyes to the ghost. You can see they're still parented to the mushroom here but I fix it off screen

##### 17/06/25
Drawing a heart out of lines using a mirror modifier to not go insane doing it, then extruding upwards and adding a bevel to give it a little more shape.

Creating a tree that is literally just a round cube and a cylinder. Not much to see here

![](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1SwKQgEmisS_2MjxwFRXaIPuruEU8OTgD&sz=s300)

Here's the scene so far!

![](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1mU_HKHJj0_qNK7n_mpHSlatEaMn3gg6-&sz=s300)

Modelling a leaf out of a plane for use on the tree as a detail. It's similar to the heart process except starting from a plane, making it curve a bit and adding a bevel only on the inner line.

##### 18/06/25
Making a ladder. It gets its base structure from a plane (I didn't show it but there are loop cuts where the bars go) then I turn it into a curve and throw cornflour on it so it gets thicker.

### Animation
#### 24/06/25
Beginning to add animations to each element, starting with a simple "bouncing" animation for the mushroom which consists of scaling down and up on a loop.

![](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1l1H8FsCLg2pv8twXQ0Tf97ItuNPbmur8&sz=s300)

I also decided to add my own blinking animation which works similarly by scaling the eyes to be shorter and wider, then returning.

![mushroom animations](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1xguuK85VelZz3ILhTgAM62rrSXjTGHH8&sz=s300)



With the mushroom done, next is the heart which is also very simple; just making a straight animation to rotate it 720 degrees. Ending the animation with the heart's rotation on a multiple of 360 is important so that it can loop.

Next up is the ghost. I use a noise modifier for the ghost's vertical position so it floats a little bit unevenly, tweaking the scale and strength so it's more subtle.

![](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1hHOPDl6rpJI1LPuiWp-ZTi7_27HiPpuJ&sz=s300)


I also unparented the ghost's eyes from its body in order to add some more ghostly effects, like making the body rotate so the skirt looks animated and wavy, and adding the same noise animation to its eyes but with some small tweaks so they move with the ghost, but a little out of sync and floaty.

Update: I forgot to make the animation for the ghost loop in the first render so I did that xd

### Shading, Rendering
#### 30/06/25
Setting up the camera position and adding a plane and some little shapes to give a bit of background interest

![](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1aa6rRFfEkwpqz2FXyg1rDzYYWAeMCUTx&sz=s300)

Adding some light sources and materials

![](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1C65qUQhPuqNhqdoisUqPswtUECRocVdW&sz=s300)
![](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1X85gLbEXB_D13vYBRZHqXxcIKG17kbsi&sz=s300)

I wanted to make the ghost appear partially transparent, so used shader nodes to modify its alpha value based on the vertical position, creating a gradient effect.

![](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1rzMGcMJZqsX_mZ2cMNoZJHQr2eKuv0_B&sz=s300)
![](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1DcAbe0CBKXL9lB7rLYjUcM4LFv0ijkCW&sz=s300)


The ladder model had some parts that were sticking out so I fixed it by scaling down the rungs slightly to be thinner, as well as giving it a metallic material for its texture.

### Rendering 
#### 01/07/25
Adjusting some lighting and render settings before finishing up

![](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1QULdlXIsigYtDwUflDjESTrfkAQJGaoz&sz=s300)
![](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=13WPAKCld3dys1bKdLJj8g6ewA-Uz8Sxq&sz=s300)

The first render I messed up by having it export as 120 frames instead of a video, then after the second one I realised I'd forgotten to make the ghost's animations loop, but it worked out in the end :3
