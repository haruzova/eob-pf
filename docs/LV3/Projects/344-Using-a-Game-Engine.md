### Devlog
##### 18/11/24
Starting work on a farming game with a tutorial. There was a project before this but the tutorial was a full major version behind making it super slow and I didn't like how it worked so I did this one instead. *(maybe add link to the old one idfk)*
##### 19/11/24
Creating a controllable player character with an animation tree for movement, and starting work on a state machine for different actions like tilling land or watering crops.
Ran into an issue where animations wouldn't play and some of the movement animations were facing the wrong way, fixed it by reordering the keys(????? are they keys?) so they encouraged the correct animation for the direction. TLDR I mixed up the Y axis lol
##### 20/11/24
Further work on the state machine, now the player can transition to chopping, watering or tilling. I deviated from the tutorial and made it so you can click while moving to stop and transition into using an action, because I prefer that than having to manually stop just to act. Apparently I ran into some bugs but fool that I am I did not even bother to explain what they were so I no longer know what the bugs are. Beautiful <3

##### 25/11/24
More tilemap stuff. Creating multiple different houses, each in their own scene and using a house-specific tilemap, before adding them to the game tilemap using scene collections so they can be instantiated and deleted as if they were one tile. I added functional doors using the same method (separate door scene, then instantiating it in the houses' tilemap) and added a script so they automatically open and close in response to the player.
